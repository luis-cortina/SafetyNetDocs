Visual Studio Quick Start Project
=================================

Getting started building tests usually involves a lot of work, finding the Selenium dlls, gathering the web drivers and putting it all into a Visual Studio Project. AS part of this tool we wanted to provide an easy way to get started with one click.
With the tool installation, a new type of Visual Studio Project gets added that will do just that.
