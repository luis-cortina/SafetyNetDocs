C# Coded Tests
==============

This is the most powerful way for developers to write their own tests. There is a predefined template to create the shell of a test. Here are a few notes bout using the UIMaps inside the tests.

- UI Maps will show in code as static classes.
- Each element shows as a property of the class. (UIMapName.Element)
- Each element will correspond to the type they have on the website.
