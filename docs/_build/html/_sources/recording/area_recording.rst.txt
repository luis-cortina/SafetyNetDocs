Area Recording
==============

Area Reording enables you to record all interactable controls inside a specific area(div or any content control).

By default the following controls are automatically recorded:

* <select></select>
* <a></a>
* <input></input> (text, checkbox, radio, submit)
* <button></button>

.. note::
    Hidden controls are not recorded by default. This can be changed in the Recording Settings for the particular UI Map.
