Getting Started
===============

To get started, please install the tool from the Visual Studio Marketplace. At this point only Visual Studio 2017 is supported.

Visual Studio Quick Start Project
=================================

Getting started building tests usually involves a lot of work, finding the Selenium dlls, gathering the web drivers and putting it all into a Visual Studio Project. AS part of this tool we wanted to provide an easy way to get started with one click.
With the tool installation, a new type of Visual Studio Project gets added that will do just that.

1. Start Visual Studio and click "Create new project".
2. Under Visual C# > Test, select Safety Net Web UIMaps project.
